# Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System

This repository contains my solution to the **Build a Website Design System** challenge project from Codecademy’s **Full-Stack Engineering** career path (Improved Styling with CSS section).

## 📖 Overview

This challenge project is designed to be open-ended. Instead of following a strict step-by-step tutorial, I was given a set of broad requirements to create a **basic design system for a website**.  

The goal was to build a reference site containing reusable styles — including colors, fonts, and other common design elements — that I can use when creating future websites.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create a reusable website design system.
- Document a color palette with HEX/RGB values.
- Define typography styles including font families, sizes, and weights.
- Include reusable UI elements such as buttons and navigation styles.
- Organize and present all styles in a clear, accessible format.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## 🚀 Features

- Centralized color swatches for consistent branding.
- Font showcase with headings, body text, and example weights.
- Styled buttons and link variations.
- A clean, minimal layout for easy reference.

## 📌 About the Challenge

This project is part of Codecademy’s **Full-Stack Engineering** career path, within the **Improved Styling with CSS** section.  
It is a capstone-style exercise focused on problem-solving, research, and self-direction — using online resources and prior lessons to complete the requirements.
